## Auto-detection

The controller detects two dimensions at runtime:

| Dimension | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| Cloud platform | `spec.providerID` on the Node object (e.g. `aws://...`, `gce://...`) |
| GPU architecture | `nvidia.com/gpu.product` node label (e.g. `NVIDIA-GB200`, `NVIDIA-H100-80GB-HBM3`) |

On a mixed-architecture target, the detected GPU architecture is the one reported by the most nodes, with ties resolved to the architecture whose earliest node sorts first by name. Nodes missing the `nvidia.com/gpu.product` label do not participate in that vote, so an unlabeled node never outvotes labeled ones; `unknown` is detected only when no target node carries the label. Every path uses the same rule: the Certification, Workflow, and WorkloadRun controllers as well as the `nvcrectl` render, cluster info, and workloadrun commands.

### ResourceSlice fallback (no device plugin/GFD)

Platforms that claim GPUs via Dynamic Resource Allocation instead of a device plugin — nscale NKS is the first — run no NVIDIA GPU Feature Discovery DaemonSet, so no node ever carries the `nvidia.com/gpu.product` label. Before the majority-architecture vote runs, node discovery lists `gpu.nvidia.com` `ResourceSlice` objects cluster-wide and reads each device's `productName` attribute, writing it as the `nvidia.com/gpu.product` label onto the corresponding node's in-memory copy (never persisted back to the API server). Every existing label-based consumer — the architecture vote, catalog architecture defaults, NIC detection — is unaffected: they only ever read the label, and simply see it populated from a different source.

This lookup is skipped entirely when every node already carries the label (every non-DRA cluster), and one `ResourceSlice` `List` call covers the whole target set. A missing `resourceslices` RBAC grant, or a driver that publishes no `productName` attribute, degrades to "leave those nodes unlabeled" rather than failing the reconcile — `unknown` architecture is the same outcome an unlabeled node with a device plugin produces today.

Offline `nvcrectl certification render` and `nvcrectl workloadrun render` have no cluster to read `ResourceSlice`s from, so on a label-less platform like nscale, offline render requires `--gpu-arch` to resolve architecture at all. `--dry-run` discovers real nodes and runs the same fallback the controllers do.

The live controller writes detection results to `status.orchestration.detectedPlatform` and `status.orchestration.detectedGPUArchitecture` on the Workflow. When using `nvcrectl workflow render` (client-side), these values are also written as annotations (`nvcrectl.nvidia.com/detected-platform`, `nvcrectl.nvidia.com/detected-gpu-architecture`) on the rendered manifest for offline inspection.

## Override matching

Catalog entries define a base `WorkflowSpec`. Overrides are matched by platform + GPU architecture and applied in order. Two patch mechanisms are supported:

### `jobTemplate` (strategic merge patch)

Replaces entire arrays. Use when you want to set all values for a field (e.g. the full `env` list):

```yaml
jobTemplate:
  spec:
    workload:
      trainJob:
        trainer:
          env:
            - name: MY_VAR
              value: "value"
```

<Warning>
Arrays in `jobTemplate` overrides are **replaced entirely**, not merged by name. If the base spec has env vars, they will be wiped unless you include them in the override.
</Warning>

### `jobTemplatePatch` (RFC 6902 JSON Patch)

Appends or modifies individual fields without replacing arrays. Use `op: add` with path ending in `/-` to append to an array:

```yaml
jobTemplatePatch:
  - op: add
    path: /spec/workload/trainJob/trainer/env/-
    value:
      name: EXTRA_VAR
      value: "extra"
```

<Warning>
A `jobTemplatePatch` that appends to an array must come **after** any `jobTemplate` override that sets that array, or the appended values will be wiped.
</Warning>

## Architecture-specific resources

Different GPU architectures and cloud platforms require different Kubernetes resources:

| Architecture | Platform | Interconnect | Key resources |
|-------------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| GB200 | AWS | EFA | `hugepages-2Mi`, `vpc.amazonaws.com/efa`, EFA hostPath volume, ComputeDomain |
| GB200 | Azure | InfiniBand | mlnxnics dep, topo ConfigMap, ComputeDomain |
| GB300 | AWS | RoCE | `roce-channel` resource claim (DRA), no hugepages, no EFA |
| GB300 | Azure | InfiniBand | mlnxnics dep, topo ConfigMap, ComputeDomain |
| H100 | AWS | EFA | `vpc.amazonaws.com/efa: 32`, no hugepages |
| H100 | Azure | InfiniBand | mlnxnics dep, topo ConfigMap |
| GB200/GB300 | On-prem | InfiniBand | arm64/GPU taint tolerations, portable IB NCCL env (no HCA pinning), NIC resource auto-detected or set via `nicResourceName`, ComputeDomain |
| B200/GB300 | nscale | InfiniBand | `gpu.nvidia.com`/`rdma.nscale.com` DRA `ResourceClaimTemplate`s (no `nvidia.com/gpu` extended-resource request; `dcgm-level4` claims the GPU only, since it runs `hostNetwork`), portable IB NCCL env (no HCA pinning), arm64/GPU taint tolerations; GB300 additionally gets the ComputeDomain block and uses `topology.nks.nscale.com/accelerator-domain` as the topology key wherever other platforms use `nvidia.com/gpu.clique` (nscale runs no GFD, so that label never exists). `dcgm-level4` still needs the GPU Operator's standalone DCGM Service (`spec.dcgm.enabled: true`) |

The live controller tracks which overrides matched in `status.orchestration.appliedOverrides`. When using `nvcrectl workflow render`, the same information is also written to the `nvcrectl.nvidia.com/applied-overrides` annotation on the rendered manifest.

## On-prem clusters

`onprem` is the detection fallback: a node with an empty `spec.providerID` (and no Forge hostname or NKE site-name label) resolves to the `onprem` platform. Nodes provisioned by bare-metal stacks such as BCM typically carry no providerID, so they land here without any configuration.

For GB200/GB300 targets, the on-prem override contributes:

- **Tolerations** for the `kubernetes.io/arch=arm64:NoSchedule` and `nvidia.com/gpu=present:NoSchedule` taints common on NVL72 deployments. Without them, workload pods never schedule on tainted arm64 nodes.
- **A portable InfiniBand NCCL environment** without HCA pinning: NCCL auto-detects HCAs when `NCCL_IB_HCA` is unset, so the same override works across sites with different HCA layouts.
- **A NIC resource request**, detected automatically or configured via `nicResourceName`. Resource names vary by RDMA device plugin (`rdma/ib`, `nvidia.com/mlnxnics`, and others are all in the wild), so when the field is unset the controller inspects the target nodes: if exactly one candidate resource (any `rdma/*` name, or the exact name `nvidia.com/mlnxnics`) is allocatable at the resolved `mlnxPerNode` count on every target node, that name is requested. Detection never guesses or over-commits: with zero candidates, with several, or when candidates exist but no node set can cover the requested count, no NIC resource is requested (pods still schedule, without an explicit NIC allocation) and a Normal `NICResourceDetection` event on the Certification or WorkloadRun explains what was found, naming the requested count when candidates fall below it. Set `nicResourceName` to override detection or to resolve an ambiguous fleet. The per-container count always comes from `mlnxPerNode`, detected or not. GB200/GB300 default `mlnxPerNode` to 8; sites running a shared-device plugin (one pooled resource per pod) should set `mlnxPerNode: 1`; with the default of 8, a pooled resource advertised as `rdma/ib: 1` is not detected, because the resulting request could never schedule.

Offline `nvcrectl certification render` and `nvcrectl workloadrun render` have no cluster to inspect, so without `--dry-run` they render field-only: the NIC resource appears only when `nicResourceName` is set. With `--dry-run`, real nodes are discovered and detection runs exactly as in the controllers.

```yaml
apiVersion: nvcre.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: Certification
metadata:
  name: onprem-gb300-cert
spec:
  target:
    nodeSelector:
      nvidia.com/gpu.product: NVIDIA-GB300
  nodesPerJob: 18
  enableMNNVL: true
  # Extended resource name advertised by the site's RDMA device plugin.
  # Optional: when omitted, the controller auto-detects a single qualifying
  # rdma/* or nvidia.com/mlnxnics resource allocatable at the mlnxPerNode
  # count on every target node.
  # Set it to override detection or when several candidates are advertised.
  nicResourceName: rdma/ib
  mlnxPerNode: 1   # shared-device plugin: one pooled resource per pod
  categories:
    - domain: communication
      variant: nccl-all-reduce
```

<Warning>
**Metal3 detection trap.** Nodes with a `metal3://` providerID resolve to the `mistral` platform, not `onprem`. An on-prem site provisioned by Cluster API + Metal3 therefore silently picks up the Mistral site-specific override, which pins HCA names (`NCCL_IB_HCA`, `UCX_NET_DEVICES`) and the `rdma/ib` resource name. To preview what a generic on-prem render looks like regardless of providerID, pass the platform explicitly: `nvcrectl certification render --platform onprem <cert.yaml>`.
</Warning>

Diagnostics (`dcgm-level4`) needs no on-prem override: it already tolerates all taints and runs intra-node, so it schedules on tainted arm64 nodes unchanged.
