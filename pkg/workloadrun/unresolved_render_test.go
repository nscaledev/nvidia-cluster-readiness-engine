// --platform.
//
// That fixture proves a template submitted on its own still enforces its
// owner's gang-scheduling contract once its conditional overrides resolve. But
// saved output goes stale silently: if the CLI ever stopped emitting
// spec.gangScheduler on the unresolved path, or stopped carrying the user's
// override through, the fixture would keep passing against a document the CLI
// no longer produces and would be testing nothing.
//
// So this drives runWorkloadRunRender itself rather than the builder beneath
// it, and parses what the command actually prints. Going through the builder
// alone would miss the CLI dropping either field afterwards — it nils
// spec.overrides on the resolved path, which is precisely the kind of step
// that could grow an unresolved-path bug.
